When researchers request access to your data they may not be granted access to the whole dataset, but only to the
variables which they will use in their project. In Armadilllo, access is regulated on the project level, so you will need to create a view containing only these variables. 

## Install and load the package
You first need to install and load the package to be able to create the subsets.



```r
install.packages("MolgenisArmadillo")
```



```r
library(MolgenisArmadillo)
```

## Logging in
In order to access the files you need to log in using the URL of the Armadillo server. A browser window will be opened where you can identify yourself with the ID provider.



```r
armadillo.login("https://armadillo-demo.molgenis.net/")
#> [1] "We're opening a browser so you can log in with code 2DQFNG"
```

A session will be created and the credentials are stored in the environment.

## Creating the subset
Let's assume you are in a consortium which has data that can not be shared in entirety to researchers. You want to share a subset of the whole dataset with certain researchers that applied for access to your data. There
are two ways that you can do this.

### Specify the required variables in a separate .csv file.

For each research project, you first create a .csv file containing 5 columns:

| source_folder | source_table | target_folder | target_table | variable      |
| ------------- | -----------  | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 2_1_core_1_0  | yearly_rep   | project1      | yearly_vars  | green_dist_   |
| 2_1_core_1_0  | yearly_rep   | project1      | yearly_vars  | green_size_   |
| 2_1_core_1_0  | yearly_rep   | project1.     | yearly_vars  | green_access_ | 

'source_folder' refers a folder within the master project; 'source_table' refers to the name of a table within this folder, 
'target_folder' refers to the name for the new folder within the target project, 'target_table' refers to the name of the 
new table within 'target_folder' and 'variable' refers to one or more variables within source_table ('source_project' and 'target_project' are specified later). 

Note that these columns need to be named exactly as above.

Once you have defined the tables then you can construct the '`subset_definition`. This creates a tibble within R holding the details from the .csv file.



```r
subset_definition <- armadillo.subset_definition(
  reference_csv = "data/subset/vars.csv")
subset_definition
#> # A tibble: 3 × 5
#>   source_folder   source_table target_folder target_table target_vars      
#>   <chr>           <chr>        <chr>         <chr>        <list>           
#> 1 2_1-core-1_0    yearlyrep    core          year_rep     <tibble [14 × 1]>
#> 2 1_1-outcome-1_0 yearlyrep    outcome       year_rep     <tibble [9 × 1]> 
#> 3 2_1-core-1_0    nonrep       core          non_rep      <tibble [5 × 1]>
```

After this you can create a new subset using the subset method on the Armadillo. 



```r
armadillo.subset(
  input_source = "subset_def",
	source_project = "gecko",
	target_project = "study1",
	subset_def = subset_definition
)
#> Created project 'study1' without users
#> ✔ All views were successfully created!
#> ✔ View 'core/year_rep' successfully created
#> ✔ View 'outcome/year_rep' successfully created
#> ✔ View 'core/non_rep' successfully created
```

This method is generally the best choice if you need to create subsets for multiple tables.

## Specifying the subset via arguments
An alternative is to specify the subset in R, via arguments to the `armadillo.subset` function:


```r
armadillo.subset(
  input_source = "arguments",
	source_project = "gecko",
	source_folder = "2_1-core-1_0", 
	source_table = "yearlyrep",
	target_project = "study2",
	target_folder = "core",
	target_table = "year_rep", 
	target_vars = c("occup_f1_", "occupcode_f2_", "edu_f1_", "edu_f1_fath", "edu_f2_", "edu_f2_fath", "pets_", "cats_", "cats_quant_", "dogs_")
)
#> Created project 'study2' without users
#> ✔ All views were successfully created!
#> ✔ View 'core/year_rep' successfully created
```
This method may be easier if you only need to create one small subset.

### Checking subsets
Now you can also take a look at the files in the armadillo user interface, if you open it in a browser window.
