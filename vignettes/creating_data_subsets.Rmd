When researchers request access to your data they may in many cases not be granted access to the whole dataset, but only to a subset. In Armadilllo, access is regulated on the project level, so you will need to create a new project using a subset of the data. Here are the required steps to create these subsets.

## Install and load the package
You need to install and load the package first to be able to create the subsets.


```r
install.packages("MolgenisArmadillo")
```


```r
library(MolgenisArmadillo)
```

## Logging in
In order to access the files you need to log in using the URL of the Armadillo server. A browser window will be opened where you can identify yourself with the ID provider.


```r
armadillo.login("https://armadillo-demo.molgenis.net/")
#> [1] "We're opening a browser so you can log in with code 8T3ND2"
```

A session will be created and the credentials are stored in the environment.

## Defining the subset
Let's assume you are in a consortium which has data that can not be shared in total to the researchers. You want to share a subset of the whole dataset with certain researchers that applied for access to your data.

For each research project, we need to define a .csv file containing 3 columns:

| folder       | table       | variable      |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| 2_1_core_1_0 | yearly_rep  | green_dist_   |
| 2_1_core_1_0 | yearly_rep  | green_size_   |
| 2_1_core_1_0 | yearly_rep  | green_access_ |

'folder' refers a folder within the master project; 'table' refers to the name of a table within this folder, and 'variable' refers to one or more variables within this table. Note that these columns need to be named exactly as above.

If you defined the tables then you can construct the `subset_definition`. This creates a tibble within R holding the details from the .csv file.


```r
subset_definition <- armadillo.subset_definition(
  vars = "data/subset/vars.csv")
subset_definition
#> # A tibble: 3 × 3
#>   folder          table     vars_to_subset   
#>   <chr>           <chr>     <list>           
#> 1 2_1-core-1_0    yearlyrep <tibble [15 × 1]>
#> 2 1_1-outcome-1_0 yearlyrep <tibble [9 × 1]> 
#> 3 2_1-core-1_0    nonrep    <tibble [7 × 1]>
```

After this you can create a new subset using the subset method on the Armadillo. First we are going to perform a dry-run to check whether the required folder, tables and variables are present.


```r
not_available <- armadillo.subset(
	source_project = "gecko",
	new_project = "study1",
	subset_def = subset_definition,
	dry_run = TRUE
)
not_available
#> # A tibble: 23 × 3
#>    folder       table     missing      
#>    <chr>        <chr>     <chr>        
#>  1 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep green_dist_  
#>  2 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep green_size_  
#>  3 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep green_access_
#>  4 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep ndvi100_     
#>  5 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep ndvi300_     
#>  6 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep ndvi500_     
#>  7 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep blue_dist_   
#>  8 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep blue_size_   
#>  9 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep blue_access_ 
#> 10 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep no2_         
#> # ℹ 13 more rows
```

This outputs a tibble with details of any variables that are missing within the actual data. You can check whether you suspected this or this is an anomaly.

If you are confident that it will work you can run the subset method without dry_run.


```r
armadillo.subset(
	source_project = "gecko",
	new_project = "study1",
	subset_def = subset_definition, 
	dry_run = FALSE
)
#> Created project 'study1'
#> Compressing...
#> Uploaded 2_1-core-1_0/yearlyrep
#> Compressing...
#> Uploaded 1_1-outcome-1_0/yearlyrep
#> Compressing...
#> Uploaded 2_1-core-1_0/nonrep
#> # A tibble: 23 × 3
#>    folder       table     missing      
#>    <chr>        <chr>     <chr>        
#>  1 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep green_dist_  
#>  2 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep green_size_  
#>  3 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep green_access_
#>  4 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep ndvi100_     
#>  5 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep ndvi300_     
#>  6 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep ndvi500_     
#>  7 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep blue_dist_   
#>  8 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep blue_size_   
#>  9 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep blue_access_ 
#> 10 2_1-core-1_0 yearlyrep no2_         
#> # ℹ 13 more rows
```

Now you can also take a look at the files in the armadillo user interface, if you open it in a browser window.
