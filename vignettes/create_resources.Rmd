```r
library(MolgenisArmadillo)
```

If you want to perform “omics”-like analyses you probably need to upload data (resources). By default Armadillo supports file uploads up to 500MB.
If you need to upload larger resources, please contact molgenis-support@umcg.nl.

There are 2 roles you can assume using the package. The datamanager role and the researcher role.

## Datamanager
The datamanager needs to make the data available to the researchers. Besides this you need to create the resources to access the data.

## Researcher
The researcher can call DataSHIELD analysis methods on the data uploaded by the datamanager.

### Upload the data
As a datamanager you need to access the Armadillo webinterface to be able to access the resource.

1. We are using data from the following sources:
  - https://github.com/isglobal-brge/brge_data_large/blob/master/data/gse66351_1.rda
  - https://github.com/isglobal-brge/brge_data_large/blob/master/data/gse66351_2.rda
2. Login with your institute account.
3. Create a project. For example `omics`.
4. Click on the edit project button to the right of the name of your project.
5. Create a new folder for your data. For example `ewas`.
6. Click on the "Select a file to upload" button or drag your file to upload to the box and click on "Upload". Upload the omics data.


### Upload the resources (in Rstudio)
A second option to upload data (resources) is on the [Central Analysis Server (CAS)](https://lifecycle.analysis.molgenis.org/) within Rstudio
As datamanager you first need to login to Armadillo (as `superuser`)



```r
armadillo.login("https://armadillo3-01.molgeniscloud.org")
#> [1] "We're opening a browser so you can log in with code T9Y2CT"
```

#### Install prerequisites
If you want to install a package on the Armadillo Rserver you can execute the following. The selected profile is always `default` if none is specified. If your profile doesn't have the `resourcer` package installed, install it:


```r
install.packages("resourcer")
#> Error in install.packages : Updating loaded packages
library(resourcer)
```

#### Create resources
In order to be able to assign the data uploaded in the armadillo you need to create the resources as well.
The data files you uploaded to armadillo, can be retrieved via the following URL:
`yoururl + /storage/projects/{project name}/objects/{folder name}%2F{filename}` and example is:
`https://armadillo3-01.molgeniscloud.org/storage/projects/omics/objects/ewas%2Fgse66351_1.rda`. Here the URL is
`https://armadillo3-01.molgeniscloud.org`, the project name is `omics`, the folder is `ewas` and the name of the
data file is `gse66351_1.rda`.


```r
resGSE1 <- resourcer::newResource(
  name = "GSE66351_1",
  url = "https://armadillo3-01.molgeniscloud.org/storage/projects/omics/objects/ewas%2Fgse66351_1.rda",
  format = "ExpressionSet"
)
resGSE2 <- resourcer::newResource(
  name = "GSE66351_1",
  url = "https://armadillo3-01.molgeniscloud.org/storage/projects/omics/objects/ewas%2Fgse66351_1.rda",
  format = "ExpressionSet"
)

armadillo.upload_resource(project="omics", folder="ewas", resource = resGSE1, name = "GSE66351_1")
#> Compressing...
#> Uploaded ewas/GSE66351_1
armadillo.upload_resource(project="omics", folder="ewas", resource = resGSE2, name = "GSE66351_2")
#> Compressing...
#> Uploaded ewas/GSE66351_2
```

The data is now available for researcher to assign.
